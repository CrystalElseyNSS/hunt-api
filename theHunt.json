She practiced those skills working for others, and refined them when she created and ran her own business. At her core, she's solution-oriented with a great eye for detail and understanding of process, which is why I was so excited when she started at Nashville Software School, a bootcamp in which she excelled and from which we've consistently hired over the years. Aside from that, I think she'd be an excellent culture fit, and would bring a lot of personality to the organization.\"",
